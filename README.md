Inforensics osint-vm is a cutting-edge Linux distribution designed specifically for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigators. Built on the solid foundations of Debian, Kali, and antiX images, Inforensics brings together a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to empower digital investigators in their quest for information. We make sure Inforensics osint-vm does not use out-of-date tools that have not been updated in 3+ years. Only the most current and useful tools we use ourselves are included.

## Background

Inforensics osint-vm is a continuation of specialized Linux distributions that began with the creation of [L.A.S. Linux](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=las) (Local Area Security Linux), a precursor to Kali Linux in the early 2000s.

L.A.S. Linux gained recognition for its innovation and utility that it was featured as Hack #100 in Kyle Rankin's "Knoppix Hacks" book.

## The Evolution from L.A.S. to Inforensics osint-vm

Drawing from the success and lessons learned from L.A.S. Linux, Jascha has crafted Inforensics osint-vm to meet the evolving needs of modern OSINT investigators. Like its predecessor, Inforensics is built with a focus on:

1. **Specialized Toolset**: Carefully curated selection of high-quality OSINT tools, avoiding redundancy and ensuring each inclusion serves a unique purpose.
2. **Regular Updates**: Commitment to frequent updates, ensuring investigators always have access to the latest tools and security patches.
3. **Community-Driven Development**: Embracing feedback and contributions from the OSINT community to continually improve and expand the distribution's capabilities.

## Key Features of Inforensics osint-vm
