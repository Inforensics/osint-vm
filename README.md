# Inforensics osint-vm

## A Powerful OSINT Tool for Modern Investigators

Inforensics osint-vm is a cutting-edge Linux distribution designed specifically for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigators. Built on the solid foundations of Debian, Kali, and Tracelabs images, Inforensics brings together a comprehensive suite of tools and resources to empower digital investigators in their quest for information.

## Behind Inforensics

Inforensics osint-vm is the brainchild of Jascha Wanger, a seasoned expert with over 25 years of experience in creating custom Linux distributions, OSINT, Cybersecurity, AI, and Cloud technologies. Jascha's journey in the world of specialized Linux distributions began with the creation of L.A.S. Linux (Local Area Security Linux), a precursor to the now-famous Kali Linux.

L.A.S. Linux gained recognition for its innovation and utility that it was featured as Hack #100 in Kyle Rankin's "Knoppix Hacks" book.

## The Evolution from L.A.S. to Inforensics

Drawing from the success and lessons learned from L.A.S. Linux, Jascha has crafted Inforensics osint-vm to meet the evolving needs of modern OSINT investigators. Like its predecessor, Inforensics is built with a focus on:

1. **Specialized Toolset**: Carefully curated selection of high-quality OSINT tools, avoiding redundancy and ensuring each inclusion serves a unique purpose.
2. **Regular Updates**: Commitment to frequent updates, ensuring investigators always have access to the latest tools and security patches.
3. **Community-Driven Development**: Embracing feedback and contributions from the OSINT community to continually improve and expand the distribution's capabilities.
